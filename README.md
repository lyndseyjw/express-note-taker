## A Note Taker App Using Express To Save User Input & Display Past Posts

An application that can launch from any browser & save / display inputs that other computers have posted. This is a way for teammembers to have access to the same 'to do list' & can delete + add notes. This is a dynamic interface that allows teammembers to check the progress of the work to be done on their projects. Once all the tasks have been completed, the team can use the same URL to get started once again!

I was inspired to create this application because I love to see all of the tasks I need to complete within a project - it gives me an idea of how to structure my plan & time manage. There is also great satisfaction in deleting a task once it is complete. As employees are beginning to work more remote, I feel that having a 'homebase' is a great way to stay connected & visually track progress on projects. 

The application is easy to use, simply click the 'Get Started' button on the main page & from here, all past notes will display in the left column. If there aren't any notes yet, then users can post their first one by inputing the 'title' & 'text content' .. once the user begins typing, a save button will appear in the top right corner. When the note is saved, it will appear on the left. As users complete a task, they can delete it & it will disappear.
